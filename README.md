# time_series_models_forecast

## ABOUT
Welcome to time series model forecast project - this project is base on evaluating diverse time series
models on a dataset. whether you are a data scientist, researcher or enthusiast, this project simply 
provide  a comprehensive set of tools to assess and compare the performance of various time series model.
this project is implemented both on a notebook as well as scripts, the coding style follows the PEP8 rules. 

### Objectives
the task consist of doing the following:
  - add weather amd later holidays to the different models and check the effects for the week of Waitangi day 2018
  - calculate the RMSE for the period you visualised, and compare the RMSE to the model without holidays.
  - compare the different models with these added regresors 
  
 answer questions such as:
  - Is there a decrease in RMSE when you add holidays?
  - Give your own interpretation of the fit (did it improve the prediction on waitangi day or not)
  - if it does not work you should investigate why and try to get it to work, or explain why it will not work
